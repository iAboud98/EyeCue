- (Optional) Saves frame to storage/DB  
- Processes frame for attention analysis  
- Sends alerts if needed  
- Sends results to teacher  

**3. Teacher Side**

## Azure Services Comparison and Recommendations

Some Azure services overlap in functionality or have alternatives. Below is a comparison to help decide the best fit for our MVP

---

### 1. Backend Hosting: App Service vs Azure Container Apps

| Factor                  | App Service                                   | Azure Container Apps                     |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Ease of Use             | Easier for simple, non-containerized apps    | Best for containerized workloads        |
| Deployment              | Supports code and containers                  | Container-native deployment              |
| Scaling                 | Auto-scale, less flexible                      | Designed for microservices and scale-out|
| Operations Overhead     | Lower                                         | Slightly higher due to container management |
| **Recommendation**      | Use **App Service** if backend is simple     | Use **Container Apps** if containers are needed |

---

### 2. Real-time Communication: Azure Web PubSub vs Azure SignalR Service

| Factor                  | Azure Web PubSub                              | Azure SignalR Service                    |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Protocol Support        | WebSocket, REST, multi-language clients      | Primarily SignalR protocol (.NET focused) |
| Integration             | Language-agnostic, flexible                    | Best for Microsoft/.NET ecosystems      |
| **Recommendation**      | Prefer **Azure Web PubSub** for flexibility  | Use SignalR only if frontend uses SignalR |

---

### 3. NoSQL Storage: Azure Table Storage vs Azure Cosmos DB

| Factor                  | Azure Table Storage                           | Azure Cosmos DB                         |
